  specifically how infants develop and apply mental models of objects.

  ### The brain is truly my passion

  An understanding if only as solid as the knowledge it is based upon. The human brain
  is still an enormous enigma to the scientific community, one that challenges and 
  motivates me every day to think critically and flexibily on how best to design and test
  new hypothesises.
